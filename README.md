# TC-TM
The toy model (TM) for the annual number of tropical cyclones (TCs)

The main code files and simulated data are contained.

# Introduction

A toy model for the annual number of global TCs is proposed, focusing on the impact of TC-environment interactions with the recovery process. Favorable environmental conditions are necessary for the formation of TCs, but the interaction between TCs and the environment will greatly affect the environment, making it unfavorable for TC development in a short term. Through defining the recovery time and introducing the major development region (MDR), the toy model can reproduce TC activity and number in reality.
